# Module 11 Practical Application 2 - Used Car Price Prediction: Regression Analysis

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict the key driving factors behind used car prices. Using a regression model trained on a dataset of used cars, the goal is to provide insights that can help used car dealers optimize their inventory and pricing strategies.


## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis includes a comprehensive set of used car listings, containing information on:

* Make & Model
* Year of Manufacture
* Mileage
* Condition
* Fuel Type
* Transmission Type
* Location
* Price (Target Variable)

The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure quality insights and accurate predictions.

## Methodology

The following steps were undertaken to develop the regression model:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature selection, and normalization.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying correlations, distribution of key variables, and price trends.
3. Feature Engineering: Creating new meaningful features to enhance model performance.
4. Model Selection: Training and evaluating multiple regression models to determine the best performer.
5. Model Evaluation: Assessing model accuracy using metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Key Findings

* Mileage: Strongly correlated with price; higher mileage generally leads to lower value.
* Car Age: Newer cars tend to retain higher value.
* Brand Influence: Some brands retain value better than others.
* Transmission & Fuel Type: Certain types have a price premium based on demand.

## Business Implications

For used car dealers, these insights can be used to:
* Optimize Pricing: Adjust prices based on key influencing factors.
* Improve Inventory Selection: Stock vehicles that retain value better.
* Targeted Marketing: Identify high-demand vehicle types for better promotion.
